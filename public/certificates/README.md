Place your certificate PDF files in this folder using the filenames referenced in `src/components/Skillset/Certificates.jsx`.

Current expected filenames:
- stress-management-virtual-assistant.pdf
- certificate-6.pdf

After adding the PDFs, the "View / Download" buttons will open and download them at: `/PortFolio/certificates/<filename>.pdf`.

If your site is served from the root instead of `/PortFolio/`, update the `pdfLink` paths in `Certificates.jsx` accordingly.
